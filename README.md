CrazyCodr GameDevTycoon Mod
===========================
This is my first mod at GameDevTycoon. It is composed of two features :

- Snapping for sliders
- Simplicity modification

Installation
------------
1. Follow the instructions on: http://forum.greenheartgames.com/t/official-modding-f-a-q/9144/19 to enable mod support in your Game Dev Tycoon installation
2. Download the ZIP for this mod using the link on this page at the lower right side in the side menu bar
3. Deflate the ZIP into the appropriate folder making sure the folder is called "crazymod"
4. Enable the mod in the mod menu of the game
5. RESTART the game
6. Create a new company to use the Simplicity Modification, else, the slider is automatic for all companies, even started ones!

Snapping for sliders
--------------------
Since the introduction of game hints, we have been told to assign +++, ++, +, ~, -, --, --- values to our game development sliders. I always found it inconvenient to find the most appropriate values when we already have hints available. Thus, here are slider snaps. When moving the sliders with my mod, you will notice that it will snap to predefined increments that match the existing list of values:

- +++ (Full)
- ++
- +
- ~ (Equals)
- -
- --
- --- (Empty)

This allows you to better distribute your sliders in a more specific fashion.

Simplicity modification
-----------------------
I always wanted to make the game simpler to play while not inducing a real cheat like advantage. This modification is a turn on/off feature that you activate within the options tab when starting a new game. The mod allows you to turn on or off the cheat feature by selecting if you want a +0, +5, +10, +15, +20, +30 or +50 bonus to your selected stats everytime you complete a game.

You cannot change this feature once activated and note that having a too high value will not make game development easier and instead will probably ruin it. I use +20, +30 and +50 only to test something really quickly in the game and so should you. Playing with a +5 or +10 gives a very small advantage over time and will not ruin the game experience and so far, i've found that +15 gives quite a good boost but keeps the game stable.

You can also choose that will be upgraded each time you finish a game, you are not entitled to seeing everything upgraded!

Roadmap
-------
I have no feature planned for now, but i encourage you to submit new ideas in the issue tracker, i'll see what i can do!
